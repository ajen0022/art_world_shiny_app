# Shiny App

This is a Shiny app developed after conducting data analysis, showcasing my work and insights.

* The creator of this app is **Amrita Jena**.
* The data used for this app  is from Tate Art Museum. 

The goal of the app is in part explanatory (identify factors that affect what we see in a plot) and in part descriptive (describing the marginal or joint distribution of data).
